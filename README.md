# SALES-DATA-PROJECT ANALYSIS
# INTRODUCTION: 
This is my first analysis of an open-source dataset during my Excel class with @Dahel Techies, using Excel to query data from the dataset.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
## To answer key questions such as 
- What is the minimum revenue?
- What is the maximum revenue?
- What is the average revenue?
- Creating  visualizations  showing revenue by country and gender, proportion of revenue by age band, and revenue generated by male and female in eacg country.
# DATA PREPERATION
- I created a new column for year and weekday from the order date that was provided, using =YEAR(F2) for year, and =(TEXT(F2,"yyyy-mm")) for weekday, where F2 represents Orderdate.
- I merged the first name and last name column together as the customer name and put it in lowercase as instructed,
- I created a new column for customer age from the birthdate and order date using =YEAR(F2)-YEAR(H2) where F2 represents Orderdate and H2 represents Birthdate
- I derive the age band based on categories using the =IF(Customer's age>=13, IF(Customer's age<=19, "Teenager",IF(Customer's age>=20, IF(Customer's age<=34, "Young Adult",IF(Customer's age>=35, IF(Customer's age<=49, "Adult",IF(Customer's age>=50, IF(Customer's age<=64, "Seniors",IF(Customer's age>=65, "Elderly"))))))).
